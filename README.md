# linear-life-time
<p>
  This is a project that I found abandoned, in half, when I oppened my Pycharm, I think I stopped because it seemed a little depressing, but with noisy neighbors resulting no sleep, and as the server for my
  online course is being fixed, I decided to finish it.

<h2>What it do?</h2>
<p>
  Calculates the time you've been on Earth and gives an average lifespan you still have based on generic questions.
